    <h1>Built Without Limits</h1>
    <p>
      The Ninja H2R is not just a motorcycle. It is Kawasaki’s statement of what
      is possible when engineering is allowed to ignore the usual restrictions and
      focus purely on performance.

      <h2>The Idea Behind the H2R</h2>
      <p>
        The Ninja H2R was created as a flagship project, bringing together
        expertise from multiple Kawasaki divisions, including aerospace and
        gas turbine engineering. The goal was simple: create a machine that
        feels like nothing else on a racetrack.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the distinctive supercharger sound to the aggressive aerodynamic
        bodywork, every part of the H2R is designed to deliver an experience that
        is brutally fast yet highly controlled when ridden by skilled hands.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Developed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries as a cross-division project</li>
        <li>Focus on extreme acceleration and high-speed stability</li>
        <li>Dedicated track-only machine, not homologated for street use</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Aerospace Influence</h3>
        <p>
          Winglets and body shapes are tuned using know-how taken from Kawasaki’s
          aerospace division, helping the H2R stay planted at extreme speeds.

      <div class="about-highlight-card">
        <h3>Supercharged Identity</h3>
        <p>
          The in-house designed supercharger gives the H2R a unique power delivery
          and sound that sets it apart from conventional litre-class superbikes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-highlight-card">
        <h3>Track-Only Focus</h3>
        <p>
          No indicators, no mirrors, no compromises. The H2R strips away
          road-legal requirements to focus purely on performance on closed circuits.
